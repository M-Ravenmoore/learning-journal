## Essencential Terminal notes

- `pwd` (print working directory) : this prints the directory path you are accessing
- `ls` : this lists the folders and files in the current directory
- `cd` : this command lets you change the current directory
- to deal with spaces in file names use quotes or a reverse slash( these are known as escape characters)
- adding a `-a` to ls shows hidden files
- **everything is a file in linux**
- ** watch your cases** linux is also case sensitive
